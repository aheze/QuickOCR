Sounds like a really good app with a lot of potential. Unfortunately, I won't be able to use it.
Though well intentioned and appreciated for the work you put into making this app, you like
many Developers have failed to pay attention to issues of accessibility. I'm a blind person who
uses the Voice Over, screen-reader on my iPhone. Such an app could be extremely helpful to
folks like myself in many ways. If you were to ask Siri to, "Turn on Voice Over" while in your app,
you would noticed that since you haven't labeled the buttons properly, all the screen-reader says
is, "button," thus making the app for someone like me unusable.
Hopefully you'll be able to fix the problem so your appwill be more inclusive.
I didn't want to post this on your ratings cause I couldn't give it a high one due to the problems
I've mentioned here. If in the future you resolve this problem, then I'll give a better rating.
Peace.
